# CI Time Tracker

A simple time tracker for comprehensible input. Works best on mobile. 

**Installation and usage**

- On your phone's browser go to https://billyc.github.io/timetracker
- Then use your browser's "Add to Home Screen" feature to add an icon for the site to your phone's home screen or app list. 

Now every time you watch a video or get some input, put in the number of minutes. The app will keep a running total of all your input and make some nice graphs.

The "Initial Hours" are added to the running total. So if you gave yourself some initial hours before using the app, enter them here.

You can also tap any date on the calendar to edit the total minutes for that day; useful if you are entering data from a different source.

**Sync**

Nope, sorry! There's no back-end server database so it doesn't sync between devices. Just pick one device and use that :-) and you can export/import data in JSON format to move between devices.

Have fun :-)
